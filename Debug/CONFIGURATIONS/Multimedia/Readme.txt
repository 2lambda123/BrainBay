BrainBay Multimedia Configurations
-----------------------------------

Note that some of these configurations need special third party software
and / or Hardware add-ons.

Bike Training:  This configuration reads a reed-sensor connected to the
                wheel of a home-trainer via one ModularEEG button. The
                configuration controls playback of an avi movie 
                according to the cycling speed.

Dance Suit:  This configuration needs a two-axis accelerometer connected
             to the channels 3 and 4 of the Modular/Monolith EEG. The
             acceleration / movements trigger midi sounds

Brainrace:   This configuration needs the "Brainracing"- Software running 
             in parallel and a modified slotcar racing set. The BrainBay-
             configuration transfers the alpha-activities to the Brainracing
             applicationvia midi-bridge, where the speed of two slotcars
             is modified by the EEG-alpha levels.

Audiomulch:  This configuration sends frequency activity information
             to the sound synthesis and processing software Audiomulch by
             Ross Bencina. Sound Output is generated / modified there.

Mindreading Martinimaker:  This needs a Modular/MonolithEEG with 
            bidirectional (P21) firware and additional hardware
            (motor driver + liquor-pumps). The pumps are triggerd
            by the configuration. At the end of one game, you get 
            a martini cocktail that fits your EEG-levels.
